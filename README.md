![PIKA BOT (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1edad157-5186-4bbb-9bfe-ac9a06ff42e4)

This OPFactions bot is a Demo version of the real OPFactions bot, I released it lite Obfuscated, you can still read it there is nothing else than the bot itself, You can try to deobfuscate it and show your resoults, I dont know how "good" Obfuscate it is, u can always experiment with this code and test it out, it has all the things in the screenshot + a some more as "Send ingame message command" prefix in the config.json, If you find any bug u can dm me in discord ".crystalwrld", The code will be probably UPDATED here or in a new post, I want to fix any bugs if there are any and then to release it Non-Obfuscated with all the fixed features, this is a test version of the bot, i will release the full version with bugs fixed, raw code and more functions. You can leave a star if you like it and find it usefull, thank you!
